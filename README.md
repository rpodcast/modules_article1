This Shiny application demonstrates useful techniques to employ a smooth and clear model for communcation between modules as well as with the overall application:

* Documenting module user interface and server functions using a similar process as documenting package functions via roxygen-style comments.
* Capturing input values explicitily in the return object of a module server function as an effective way to clearly define the purpose of a module.
